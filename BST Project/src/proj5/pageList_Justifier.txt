For my pageList, I opted to use array implementation.
It is not completely an array, as it also houses an instance variable that
contains the word we are counting.
The reason I chose this implementation is that the organization of the page numbers
was already fairly linear, just like an array would be. When checking if a word has
already been used on a page, the only page number you need to check is the
previous one, which is easily checked and does not require a complete incrementation
through the entire array, a disadvantage that arrays normally carry. A major disadvantage
of arrays is that in comparison to completely abstract data types not based off of
any preexisting models, like trees or linkedLists, arrays are difficult to
"generalize". Creating an array that can hold generic types requires additional
work and typecasting that may normally would not be needed.
